PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

PubChem is a freely available database of chemical structures of small organic molecules and information on their biological activities. It contains structure, nomenclature and calculated physico-chemical data and is linked with NIH PubMed/Entrez information. PubChem is organized as three linked databases within the NCBI's Entrez information retrieval system. These are PubChem Substance, PubChem Compound, and PubChem BioAssay. PubChem also provides a fast chemical structure similarity search tool. PubChem has >111 million unique chemical structures. 


ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/); current release ChEMBL_v29 (2,084,724 molecules)

Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on 'small' chemical compounds. The chemical entities in ChEBI are either products of nature (metabolites) or synthetic products used to intervene in the processes of living organisms (drugs or toxins). ChEBI contains structure and nomenclature information along with hyperlinks to many well-regarded databases. ChEBI uses a carefully developed ontological classification, whereby the relationships between molecular entities or classes of entities and their parents and/or children are precisely specified. ChEBI has >15,500 chemical entities in its database.


DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/); current release 5.1.9

The DrugBank database is a blended bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that combines detailed drug (i.e. chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e. sequence, structure, and pathway) information. The database contains over 7,800 drug entries including nearly 2,200 FDA-approved small molecule drugs, 340 FDA-approved biotech (protein/peptide) drugs, 93 nutraceuticals and >5,000 experimental drugs. DrugBank also contains extensive SNP-drug data that is useful for pharmacogenomics studies. 


Therapeutic Target DB (http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/cjttd/)

The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) is a drug database designed to provide information about the known therapeutic protein and nucleic acid targets described in the literature, the targeted disease conditions, the pathway information and the corresponding drugs/ligands directed at each of these targets. The database currently contains 2,025 targets, 17,816 drugs, and 3,681 multi-target agents. 


T3DB (http://www.t3db.ca/) current release (3,533 molecules)

The Toxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB), or, soon to be referred as, the Toxic Exposome Database, is a unique bioinformatics resource that combines detailed toxin data with comprehensive toxin target information. The database currently houses 3,678 toxins described by 41,602 synonyms, including pollutants, pesticides, drugs, and food toxins, which are linked to 2,073 corresponding toxin target records. Altogether there are 42,374 toxin, toxin target associations. Each toxin record (ToxCard) contains over 90 data fields and holds information such as chemical properties and descriptors, toxicity values, molecular and cellular interactions, and medical information. This information has been extracted from over 18,143 sources, which include other databases, government documents, books, and scientific literature.


The Natural Products Atlas (https://www.npatlas.org/) current release v2021_08 (32,741 molecules)

The Natural Products Atlas is designed to cover all microbially-derived natural products published in the peer-reviewed primary scientific literature. This encompasses bacterial, fungal and cyanobacterial compounds, but does not include compounds from plants, invertebrates or other higher organisms unless these compounds have also been explicitly identified from a microbial source. Compounds from lichens and mushrooms and other higher fungi are included. Compounds from marine macro algae and diatoms are excluded.
