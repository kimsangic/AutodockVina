PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
PubChem is a freely available database of chemical structures of small organic molecules and information on their biological activities. It contains structure, nomenclature and calculated physico-chemical data and is linked with NIH PubMed/Entrez information. PubChem is organized as three linked databases within the NCBI's Entrez information retrieval system. These are PubChem Substance, PubChem Compound, and PubChem BioAssay. PubChem also provides a fast chemical structure similarity search tool. PubChem has >90 million unique chemical structures. 


ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/); current release ChEMBL_v29 (2,084,724 molecules)
Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on 'small' chemical compounds. The chemical entities in ChEBI are either products of nature (metabolites) or synthetic products used to intervene in the processes of living organisms (drugs or toxins). ChEBI contains structure and nomenclature information along with hyperlinks to many well-regarded databases. ChEBI uses a carefully developed ontological classification, whereby the relationships between molecular entities or classes of entities and their parents and/or children are precisely specified. ChEBI has >15,500 chemical entities in its database.

ChemSpider (http://www.chemspider.com/)
ChemSpider is an aggregated database of organic molecules containing more than 55 million compounds from many different providers. At present the database contains information from such diverse sources as a marine natural products database, ACD-Labs chemical databases, the EPA's DSSTox databases and from a series of chemical vendors. It has extensive search utilities and most compounds have a large number of calculated physico-chemical property values. 

DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/); current release 5.1.9
The DrugBank database is a blended bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that combines detailed drug (i.e. chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e. sequence, structure, and pathway) information. The database contains over 7,800 drug entries including nearly 2,200 FDA-approved small molecule drugs, 340 FDA-approved biotech (protein/peptide) drugs, 93 nutraceuticals and >5,000 experimental drugs. DrugBank also contains extensive SNP-drug data that is useful for pharmacogenomics studies. 

Therapeutic Target DB (http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/cjttd/)
The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) is a drug database designed to provide information about the known therapeutic protein and nucleic acid targets described in the literature, the targeted disease conditions, the pathway information and the corresponding drugs/ligands directed at each of these targets. The database currently contains 2,025 targets, 17,816 drugs, and 3,681 multi-target agents. 

T3DB: 3,533 molecules     http://www.t3db.ca/

SMPDB (http://smpdb.ca/)
SMPDB (The Small Molecule Pathway Database) is an interactive, visual database containing more than 618 small molecule pathways found in humans. More than 70% of these pathways (>433) are not found in any other pathway database. The pathways include metabolic, drug, and disease pathways.
